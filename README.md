## My first project
________________________________________________________________________________________
I created a webpage inspired by a local bakery to show how I can support small businesses in the hospitality and other service sectors. I first create a wireframe giving me guidance on how I would like the website to present itself aesthetically. I used HTML and CSS flexbox to design the layout of the website and built in JavaScript to make it interactive for humans in terms of submitting data.
